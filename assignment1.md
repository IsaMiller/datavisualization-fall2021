# Sometimes bars are best: Texas Tribune on homeless Texans

## Clarity and accuracy
### Central insight:
5- I was able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to convey. The article was from the get go, how much do we know about the homeless population in Texas. The point that was trying to be made is that there is no clear way of counting and keeping count of the true extent of homelessness, but here is the available data. 
### Data visualization:
5- I think the way the story flowed gave the right information first to help the reader understand what the story was going to cover. I think scrolling throughout the multiple sets of visualized data you picked up the points the reporter was making. 
### Accuracy: 
3- I only put three because (as they made it clear) the data set is not complete. There is no way, currently, to have this data 100% accurately. They provided sources, showed where data was coming from and articulated it clearly. 
## Quality
### Degree of quality:
4- I think the use of graphics in this story was a great way to visualize the data and not bog down the story with a ton of numbers. I do wish there was a little more visualization at the top of the story. 
### Type:
5-I think the use of typography was good. The typography is very simple. I think making too much of a statement with a font would take away from the story and not add to it. 
### Color: 
5- The color, like typography, is plain which suits the story well.  I think using bright, vibrant, busy colors would be taking away from the seriousness of the story. I do like how size is used as an interesting way to visualize data with the blocks. 
## Creativity
#### Creative elements:
4- I really liked how there was a visual size and ranking to some of the data, I found it as an interesting way to look at data rather than just a bar graph. Adding in race and ethnicity were interesting at the end. I really liked how none of the data seemed to skew what the story was based upon and only supported the story visually.

## Productivity in times of Turmoil  

How does the extent of crime in the District of Columbia impact resident’s quality of life? With a minor focus on how congressional employees working on the Hill’s victimization affected their productivity. 

I found a study by the Research Triangle Institute from 2006 outlining the data from that year. I want to get new data to see how it compares to the present which has featured political turmoil in the past two years and the January 6 insurrection. 

You could talk to:
* Interns 
* Congressmen and women 
* Staffers to get their opinion on the Hill’s safety 
* People who live near the Capitol
* Capitol Police

I think it would be very important for background to not only include Jan 6, but other more timely disruptions. 
For visualizations we could compare data. Make a map of the Capitol where crimes have been committed.
