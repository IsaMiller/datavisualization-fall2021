# Assignment 4 - Billionaire Breakdown
## A link to the data set. I looked at [Bloomberg's billionaire index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/).
The questions I asked before reviewing and analysing this data were:
* 1 How much disparities are there between gender and what are the most common tracks between women/men?
* 2 Is there a pattern with the amount of wealth and amount of new wealth generated?
* 3 If America has the most billionaires, how much do they have compared to other countries?

I found this data on Sunday, and used the data from that day. The Bloomberg index changes every day due to stocks being sold and bought. 

# Question 1:

What I found was that overall women tended to be specialized in food and beverage, fashion and retail over men who more commonly were in finance, technology and retail. According to my data set 10% of the 500 billionaires on the list were women which I suspected. 
So there is a wide gap between genders, and a difference in tracks. I suspected there would be but I didn’t think men would outweigh women this much. 

Finding the data for this was a little difficult as there was not a gender column to sort. I had to first make a new sheet, manually find the data and mark each as male or female. I then could use a table to find the most common specializations and then calculated averages and percentages. 

# Question 2:
I found that amount of wealth typically would have an impact on how much the billionaires gained or lost in any respect. I didn’t find a correlation between less wealth means they lose more. I did notice that technology companies were trending downward on my particular day. With about 33% the 87 tech billionaires having a small loss. I think this would be interesting to investigate further with how facebook and other social media are now being scrutinized to see if there's a connection. 

To find the data for this I first made a new sheet with just names, new gains/losses, specialization and country to separate it from my other data. I then made a new column for those who gained and lost to mark that so it could be easier to visualize and made a graph with that data. 

# Question 3:

America and China are in the top with the most billionaires. Nine out of the 10 richest billionaires were American on this date. I was expecting other countries to have a little more influence in the ranking but I found repeatedly there were an overwhelming amount of American technology billionaires. 

This was easy to find since I had to just look at the top 10. And then analyze that data. 


## HL: Bbillionaire breakdown: Tracking the top 500's wealth

Nut graf: Male Americans who work in technology are far more likely to reach the top 500 of billionaires. Out of the top ten, nine are those who qualify for those factors, and make up 17 percent on the list entirely.
